## Overview
While working full-time at NLP Finance, I noticed that the company's website and internal software could be better optimized. This app rebuilds the company’s website and internal dashboard, providing:

- A marketplace for private sellers and dealers to list vehicles  
- Financing support for customers  
- An employee dashboard to manage leads, track funded deals, and view income reports  

This project provided hands-on experience building a full front-end React application while working directly with employees to create practical solutions for real-world workflows.

## Features
- **Marketplace:** Users can browse listings from private sellers or registered dealers with financing options clearly displayed.  
- **Employee Dashboard:** Staff can review marketplace ads, manage financing leads, track funded deals, and view detailed charts and breakdowns of income (weekly, monthly, yearly).  
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Live statistics, charts, and reports for decision-making and revenue tracking.  
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and tablet devices.

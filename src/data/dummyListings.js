      "The Lund Predator 1760 tillers are rugged aluminum hunting jon boats. These 17' boats are a great utility fishing and hunting boat with a no-nonsense design including a tiller steering drive that keeps the cockpit open for tossing out duck or goose decoys. Rod holders and a livewell make it ideal for bass walleye crappie or catfishing as well.",
